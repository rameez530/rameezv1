# 💰 Loan Amount Term Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the **Loan Amount Term** — the duration a borrower will take to repay a loan. It helps banks and financial institutions improve loan planning, risk management, and customer experience.

## 📌 Introduction

The project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict how long a loan will take to be repaid, based on borrower details such as income, loan amount, credit history, education, and more.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Banks need accurate ways to estimate repayment durations for customers. This project builds an intelligent prediction model to assist in better decision-making and reduce human error.

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**
  - Ensemble of decision trees
  - High accuracy, handles real-world data well
  - Reduces overfitting

## 📊 Features Used

- `Gender`
- `Married`
- `Dependent`
- `Education`
- `Self_Employed`
- `ApplicantIncome`
- `CoapplicantIncome`
- `LoanAmount`
- `Credit_History`
- `Property_Area`

### 🎯 Target Variable
- `Loan_Amount_Term`: Predicted duration of loan repayment

## 🗃️ Dataset

- Contains financial and demographic details of applicants
- Includes both categorical and numerical variables
- Must handle missing values and encode categorical data before training

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature selection and encoding
3. Model training using Random Forest
4. Evaluation using classification metrics
5. Model testing and prediction

## 🚀 Applications

- ✅ Better Loan Planning
- ✅ Risk Mitigation
- ✅ Fast-Track Loan Approvals
- ✅ Personalized Loan Offers

## ✅ Results

The model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting loan terms using real-world datasets. It can effectively support automated decision systems in banks.

## 🧾 Conclusion

Using a Random Forest classifier, this project provides a reliable solution to estimate loan repayment terms. It supports banking operations in reducing risks, offering tailored products, and improving approval efficiency.
